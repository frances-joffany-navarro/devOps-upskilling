# DevOps
I am basing this project to the Bruxelles Formation program for [DevOps Engineer Training](https://www.bruxellesformation.brussels/catalogue-de-formations/devops-engineer-avec-certification-kubernetes/). I want to start by following the curriculum indicated in this training because I want to do this training. I believe knowing in advance won't hurt right? For this training you need to apply for their information session. Afterwards, you need to take a test and do a motivational interview to see if you are right for this training. I am not sure all about the information. Let's see it after the information session :).
